The system in this module for adding roles is awful so there is a line that does the following

$userinfo['roles'] = acexpert_control_map_user_data($ext_user);


We also apply patch #15 from https://www.drupal.org/node/1922694 to avoid "Access denied" when a user logs in.

This redirects immediately after login to ensure the authenticated user session is always available.

also

simplesamlphp_auth-create-authmap-entries-1280930-29.patch
and a couple of fixes.
To allow for exsisting users to log in if they have an email address on the system.
